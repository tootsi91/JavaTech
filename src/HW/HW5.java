 *  Write a method "print" (just one method!) that would work for the following lines:

 print("Names that start with A",
 e -> e.startsWith("A"), "Mati", "Kati", "Aadu");

 print("Values that are greater than ten",
 e -> e > 10, 40, 0, 4, -5, -14, 35, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8);

 The output of these lines should be:

 Names that start with A: Aadu
 Values that are greater than ten: 40, 35
