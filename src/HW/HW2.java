/**
 * Use the same JavaFX Tetris project that we wrote in practicum and implement a FigureGenerator that would create randomly all the figures in the Tetris game, but without any of the figures being predefined.

 In Tetris, the figures consist of 4 blocks that are placed side-by-side in every possible way (other possibilities are just rotations of these 7 figures):

 #     #    ##    #      #    #     #
 #     #    ##    ##    ##    #     ##
 ##    #           #     #    ##    #
 #

 Write an algorithm that would randomly create all possible blocks. Also, write a unit test for that functionality.
