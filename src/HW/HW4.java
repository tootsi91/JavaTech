/**
 *
 Set up a project where you have at least two types of entities (i.e categories and products), preferrably from the scratch. Every entity must have a name or description field.
 Create some functionality or automatic script to add some data to the database.
 Write a search functionality that searches every word separately. For example, if the search string is "pan pe", the entity with a name "Peter Third Pan" should be found.
 A nice-to-have: test the implementation with a unit test that uses a test database.
